# SCARA Robot (PRRR Configuration)

## Overview  
This repository contains the design, build process, and control of a 4-DoF SCARA robot. The robot features a prismatic joint and three revolute joints (PRRR configuration) and is designed for precise pick-and-place tasks. It includes a functional GUI, real-time control, and an Arduino-based system for motor control.

## 1. Introduction  
This SCARA robot is developed for industrial pick-and-place applications. The manipulator consists of:  
- A **prismatic joint** for vertical motion.  
- **Three revolute joints** for horizontal movements and rotation.  
- A **gripper** for handling square and round objects.  

The robot is controlled using an Arduino Uno and stepper motors through a CNC shield. The GUI simplifies user interaction, making the robot versatile for various tasks.

## 2. Final Outcome  
The SCARA robot successfully performs pick-and-place tasks with smooth motion and precise control.

## 3. Building Process  

### **3.1 Frame**  
In the SCARA robot building process, I first created a metal frame. I used a metal U-bar and a circular-shaped plate, soldering them as shown in Figure 3. To hold the Z-axis motor, I also soldered a plate. Afterward, I added screw holes to the grill and created two screw holes on the Z-holder plate. Additionally, I applied a coat of paint to resist metal corrosion.  

I also created screw holes in the U-bar to secure the aluminum extrusion. After that, I added a 40Ã—20 aluminum extrusion to the U-bar using M5 20mm screws. This aluminum extrusion ensures smooth movement of the joints along the Z-axis.

### **3.2 Joint 1: Prismatic Joint**  
The prismatic joint allows vertical motion and is powered by a lead screw mechanism coupled with a stepper motor.

### **3.3 Joint 2: Revolute Joint**  
The revolute joint enables horizontal rotation for broader workspace coverage.

### **3.4 Joints 3 and 4**  
These joints control finer rotations, including gripper orientation for precise object handling.

## 4. Wiring  
The wiring connects stepper motors, the CNC shield, and the Arduino Uno. Important points:  
- Use shielded cables for stepper motors to reduce noise.  
- Ensure correct polarity for stepper motor connections to avoid direction reversal.  
- Power supply: A 12V DC supply powers the entire system.  

---

## 5. Homing Sequence  
The homing sequence ensures that the robot starts from a known position:  
1. The prismatic joint retracts to the lowest position.  
2. Each revolute joint rotates to its home angle.  
3. Limit switches provide feedback to confirm positions.  

---

## 6. Pick and Place Application  
The robot is programmed to pick objects from a defined source and place them in a target location.  
1. Move to the pick position using the prismatic and revolute joints.  
2. Grip the object using the servo-controlled gripper.  
3. Transition to the target location and release the object.

## 7. GUI  
A user-friendly GUI is developed using **Processing**.  

### **Features**  
- Joint control via sliders and buttons.  
- Position control for end-effector coordinates.  
- Real-time feedback for joint angles and positions.  
- Gripper control for opening/closing actions.
